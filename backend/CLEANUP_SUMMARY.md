## 🎯 Current Email OTP System

### New Files Created

- ✅ `backend/services/emailOTPService.js` - New email OTP service
- ✅ `backend/controllers/emailOTPController.js` - New email OTP controller
- ✅ `backend/routes/emailOTPRoutes.js` - New email OTP routes (integrated into existing otpRoutes.js)

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/v1/otp/send-registration-otp` - Send OTP for registration
- `POST /api/v1/otp/send-login-otp` - Send OTP for login
- `POST /api/v1/otp/verify-otp` - Verify OTP code
- `POST /api/v1/otp/resend-otp` - Resend OTP

### Registration Flow
1. User requests OTP: `POST /api/v1/otp/send-registration-otp`
2. User receives email with 6-digit code
3. User verifies OTP: `POST /api/v1/otp/verify-otp`
4. User completes registration: `POST /api/v1/customers/register-email` with verified OTP

## 🔧 What Still Needs Phone OTP

The phone-based registration system still uses the old OTP model. When you're ready to implement phone OTP verification, you can:

1. Update the phone registration functions to use a new phone OTP service
2. Create a new phone OTP model or extend the existing OTP model
3. Integrate with SMS services like Twilio, AWS SNS, or PhilSMS

## ✅ Verification

- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ All old email verification code removed
- ✅ New email OTP system fully functional
- ✅ Customer model updated with correct field names
- ✅ Routes cleaned up and updated
